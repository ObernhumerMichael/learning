# What is this?

This is a collection of my own personal notes about various topics.
This collection is in no ways complete as I take most of my notes offline in a notebook.
In here are just the things that are way to tedious to copy down on paper or for other various reasons. 

# For the Future
- [ ] digitalize handwritten notes
- [ ] use [docosaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) to make the content publicly available
