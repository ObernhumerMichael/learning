# Learning Is Misunderstood

- Learning is deeper and more durable when it’s effortful.
- _Rereading text_ and _massed practice_ of a skill or new knowledge among the least productive study strategies.
- _Retrieval practice_ - recalling facts or concepts or events from memory - is a more effective learning strategy than review by rereading.
  Flashcards are a simple example.
- A single, simple quiz after reading a text or hearing a lecture produces better learning and remembering than rereading the text or reviewing lecture notes.
- Periodic practice arrests forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain.
- When you space out practice at a task and get a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects, retrieval is harder and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables more versatile application of it in later settings.
- Trying to solve a problem _before being taught the solution_ leads to better learning, even when errors are made in the attempt.
- Learning styles, for example an auditory or visual learners, are not supported by the empirical research.
- When you’re adept at extracting the underlying principles or "rules" that differentiate types of problems, you’re more successful at picking the right solutions in unfamiliar situations.
  - This skill is better acquired through interleaved and varied practice than massed practice.
- In virtually all areas of learning, you build better mastery when you use testing as a tool to identify and bring up your areas of weakness.
- Elaboration is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know.
  The more you can explain about the way your new learning relates to your prior knowledge, the stronger your grasp of the new learning will be, and the more connections you create that will help you remember it later.
  - Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air; to know that this is true in your own experience, you can think of the drip of water from the back of an air conditioner
- Learning is stronger when it matters, when the abstract is made concrete and personal.
  - Pilot that trains how to react to an engine failure.
