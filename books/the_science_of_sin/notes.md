# In the Beginning

## Notes

- 7 deadly sins: pride, gluttony, lust, sloth, greed, envy, wrath
- The sins are not entirely evil, e.g. lust is necessary for the survival of a species.
- Neuroplasticity describes the process by which more or less anything we do regularly and intensively, and sustain over long periods of time, induces physical changes in the very fabric of our brain.
- InGroup: The group of people you identify with and show loyalty, empathy, and trust toward. (max 150 people)
- OutGroup: The group of people perceived as different or outside your social circle, often treated with less empathy or fairness.
- 7 deadly sins = categories of human behavior that leads to dispute and social isolation
- Gods help to enforce codes of conduct (e.g. punish vices)
- The concept of religious coping suggests that blaming god for disasters helps people deal with stress and traumatic events.
- Gods help to organize very large groups of interacting humans under a shared belief system.
- Belief helps us to cooperate with the OutGroup.
- When a belief system places constraint on what other people should and shouldnâ€™t think, it goes too far, particularly when used to sanction violence.

## Cues / Questions / Keywords

- What is Neuroplasticity?
- What is InGroup and OutGroup?
- What is the role of god/religion in society?
- In an increasingly post-religious world, where is the incentive to stay on the right side of the seven deadly sins?
- Is science sufficient to inspire us to do the things that keep us happy and healthy?

## Summary

The seven deadly sins (albeit necessary sometimes) are behaviors that lead to conflicts and social isolation.
God/religion are concepts that help to maintain order and cooperation between a large group of humans.
Religion fostered group membership, but what will fill the gap with the increasing disbelief remains to see.
