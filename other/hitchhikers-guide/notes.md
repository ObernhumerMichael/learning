# Introduction

This is a summarized checklist and to-do list aimed at increasing privacy and anonymity on the internet.
It has been compiled based on the official [Hitchhiker’s Guide to Online Anonymity](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide/).
Please note that this guide is **neither exhaustive nor guaranteed to be foolproof**.
Its purpose is to provide a quick overview and actionable steps, **not** to replace the in-depth explanations and context found in the original guide.
For comprehensive details, background information, and reasoning behind each recommendation, please refer to the full Hitchhiker’s Guide.
Keep in mind that none of these methods are foolproof, and each comes with potential trade-offs and risks.

## Your Network

### Your IP address

Your IP address is easily accessible and can reveal identifying information about you.
To protect your privacy, it's important to conceal or obfuscate your origin IP address — the one that can be linked directly to your identity.
This can be achieved using one or a combination of the following methods:

- **Public Wi-Fi networks** (free)
- **The Tor anonymity network** (free)
- **VPN services used anonymously** (e.g., paid with cash or Monero)

### Your DNS and IP requests

Usually the DNS is provided and logged by your ISP.
DNS is also sent in plaintext

- Use a private DNS or your own
